## General info
* This Project is named NearBlue and it allows people to chat with people around over bluetooth and hence does not require an internet connection
* The app allows users to either become a server and listen for client request wanting to connect to us or the user can become a client and get connected to a server
* The app has a separate section for all the connected users and the new users (which are discovered around)
* We can get connected to either an old user who would already be present in the paired users list or we could find a new user and get connected
* In case of a new user, the app also has a help section where the instructions are mentioned that can help a new user to use the app
* The chats of the users are encrypted using AES Algorithm
